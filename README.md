# Final Project
I was hoping to get a demo of some of the elements I envisioned my website to have.
The API for Unsplash was unsuccessful. It tells me the token is invalid.
I was trying to get random professional pictures of musicians/music professionals/
people enjoying music shown on my page to inspire users.
I also wanted to add other API elements from Facebook and LinkedIn.
I successfully got some of the CSS elements I envisioned. The website's final name
is still in development but I want it to be in red letters like shown.
Todo items: API for Facebook and LinkedIn.
Although I'm still not sure how to use it. I just know I want people to be able
to like user's post and share some things from their own personal Facebook in order
to connect with other users. I want individuals to be able to collect their info.
from LinkedIn to add to their professional website on "MusicWay."
The career page is still in development. I want to know how to add pages to my page.
So users can flip through the pages like a book. I also want users to be able to
upload their own personal videos on their profile which is also in development.
I envision their personal profile to be like a Facebook but with mostly music content and
some social activity. I want users to be able to message other users.
Their profile would show gigs they're interested in, what projects they're currently
working on, and videos of them playing their instrument.
The career page will also allow you to create your own professional profile like in
LinkedIn.
